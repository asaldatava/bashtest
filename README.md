## To run every script first you should change mode to add execution for it:
### ```e.g. chmod u+x  src/test/java/current_data.sh``` 
## Script is run with the following command:

### ```./src/test/java/current_data.sh```

## To perform arithmetic operation for me is most convenient to use $(()).

## For loop is easier.

## To iterate arguments in testarguments.sh the for loop is used. It was used $@ - array of arguments.
## It is checked if the file path valid.
